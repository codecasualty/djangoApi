Model in Django
A model in Django is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model and represents a table in your database. Each attribute of the model class represents a field of the table or a relationship between tables. The model is the single, definitive source of truth about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle, so the model is also responsible for defining the database schema (fields and relationships), with migrations generated based on changes in the model to keep the database in sync.

Example of a Django Model:
```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    published_date = models.DateField()
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Model Manager in Django
A model manager is an interface through which Django models interact with the database. It is the bridge between your Django model objects and the database. Managers are Django's way to perform database queries. Each Django model has at least one manager, and custom managers can be created to extend or modify the default manager behavior.

```python
class AvailableBookManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_available=True)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    published_date = models.DateField()
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13)
    is_available = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    objects = models.Manager()  # Default manager.
    available_books = AvailableBookManager()  # Custom manager.

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```
In this example, Book.objects would use the default manager, providing access to all books, whereas Book.available_books would use the AvailableBookManager, which filters the books to return only those that are available.


Django admin allows use to create adminstrative access to our database.This helps us to inspect the database, see models and modify them
to create a superuser we user django cli we type command
python manage.py createsuperuser
and enter the required details and then it will help us in accessing the database using this super_user
